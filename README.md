# Java Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of **Java projects** that demonstrate various programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills. Each project is designed to be educational, interactive, and showcases different Java features such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more.

These projects are perfect for learners, hobbyists, or developers looking to improve their Java programming skills. All projects are self-contained and can be easily run either from the command line or within a Java IDE.

## Projects Included

### 1. Password Generator  
A Java application that generates secure, random passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Users can specify the desired length of the password.

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game  
A two-player console-based game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where players take turns marking their moves on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for winning conditions or a draw after each turn.

### 3. Advanced Calculator  
A versatile Java-based calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) along with advanced functions such as square roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), factorials, prime number checks, and Fibonacci sequence generation.

### 4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game  
A simple, interactive console-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Players can compete against the computer, which uses random choices.

### 5. SIP Calculator  
A Java-based SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) calculator that helps users calculate the expected returns on their investments. It includes features to adjust monthly contributions, interest rates, and investment duration.

### 6. Currency Converter  
A Java program that converts currencies based on user input and predefined exchange rates. This application demonstrates the use of conditionals and switch-case statements.

### 7. Bindaas Number Guesser  
An interactive game where the computer generates a random number within a range, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides hints to the player to help them reach the correct answer.

### 8. Student Grading System  
An advanced Java application that manages student information and calculates grades based on their marks. Features include:  
- Adding, updating, and deleting student records.  
- Searching for students by ID.  
- Calculating grades automatically based on subject-wise marks.  
- Displaying all student records.  
- Data persistence using file handling for saving and loading student records.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and a menu-driven interface.

## Features

- Demonstrates core Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, arrays, string manipulation, and recursion.
- Provides easy-to-use command-line interfaces for interactive gameplay or input.
- Simple, efficient code that can be customized or expanded for more complex applications.
