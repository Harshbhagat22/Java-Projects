# Java Projects

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Java projects demonstrating various programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving skills. Each project is designed to be educational, interactive, and showcases different Java features such as object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more.

The projects are suitable for learners, hobbyists, or developers looking to improve their Java programming skills. Each project is self-contained and can be easily run from the command line or within a Java IDE.

## Projects Included

- **Password Generator**: A Java application that generates secure, random passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Users can specify the desired length of the password.
